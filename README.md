## Tourism Experience Analytics: Classification, Prediction, and Recommendation System

This is a full-stack ML project in the Tourism domain. The goal is to analyze user travel behavior using 9 relational datasets (Transactions, Users, Cities, Attractions, Visit Modes, Continents, Countries, Regions, Types) and build three ML systems:

- Regression — Predict the rating a user will give an attraction
- Classification — Predict the visit mode (Business, Family, Couples, Friends, Solo)
- Recommendation System — Suggest personalized attractions using both Collaborative and Content-Based Filtering
